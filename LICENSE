-----------------

Subject to the terms of this License, each Contributor hereby grants You
a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license, subject to third party
intellectual property claims:
(a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)

    sell for import, and import the Modifications (or portions thereof),
    but solely to the extent that any such patent claim is necessarily
    infringed by other elements of the Modifications that alone, in the
    absence of the Covered Software, would not infringe the patent claim.

2.3. Distribution Obligations

(a) Availability of Source Code

All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under
the terms of this License making the source code for that Covered
Software freely available for anyone to copy, with no fees or charges.
You must include a prominent notice stating that the Source Code Form of
the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this MPL; and either
include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code Form or
state where to find a copy of this License. You may not attempt to alter
or restrict recipients' rights in the source code.

(b) Distribution of Executable Form

If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:
(i) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code
    Form, as described in Section 2.3(a), and You must inform recipients
    of the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code
    Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more
    than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and
(ii) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this
    License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the
    license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter
    the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.

(c) Distribution of a Larger Work

You may create and distribute a Larger Work under the terms of this
License or under other terms of Your choice, provided that You also
comply with the requirements of this License for the Covered Software.
If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered Software with a work
governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the Covered Software is
not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this License permits You to
additionally distribute Covered Software under the terms of such
Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of the Larger Work may, at
their option, further distribute Covered Software under the terms of
either this License or such Secondary License(s).

3. Limitations
--------------

(a) No Trademark License

This License does not grant any rights to use the trademarks, service
marks, or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply
with the notice requirements in Section 3(c)).

(b) Exclusions

For clarity, this License does not, and shall not be construed to,
permit any use, sale, importation or transfer of Covered Software in
violation of any applicable law or regulation of any jurisdiction.

(c) Termination

If You initiate litigation against any entity (including a
cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Covered
Software infringes any patent, then Your patent licenses from all
Contributors to the Covered Software shall terminate as of the date
such litigation is filed.

(d) No Other Rights

This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks,
or logos of any Contributor, except as expressly stated herein. Other
than as expressly stated above, rights are reserved.

4. Disclaimer of Warranty
--------------------------

Covered Software is provided under this License on an "as-is" basis,
without warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory,
including, without limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is
free of defects, merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or
non-infringing. The entire risk as to the quality and performance of the
Covered Software is with You. Should any Covered Software prove defective
in any respect, You assume the cost of any necessary servicing, repair,
or correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential part
of this License. No use of any Covered Software is authorized under this
License except under this disclaimer.

5. Limitation of Liability
---------------------------

Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including
negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law
(such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) shall any Contributor be
liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result
of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Covered
Software (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other
commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised
of the possibility of such damages.

6. Additional Terms
-------------------

6.1. If You distribute Covered Software in a form that does not include
source code or in executable form without the ability to distribute
source code, You must make source code available by other means, or
inform recipients that source code is available by alternative means.

6.2. The obligations stated in Section 3.2 shall continue in perpetuity
even after termination.

7. Miscellaneous
----------------

This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject
matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides
that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter
shall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.
